  Jake opened a sewing shop that makes clothes, particularly trousers and jackets.
  This shop uses cotton and wool as their material.
  Jake thinks that he will expand his shop to include other types of clothes and materials as well in the future.

  Our objective is to help Jake write an application what will deal with customers' interactions with clothes, without dependencies on any particular material.
